_______________
Developed custome camera engine that follows 
character movement. 

Allows full 360 degree rotation on X axis and clamps Y axis 
for smooth dynamic control of the camera.

Updated Character controller script to make sure the local
axis of the character follows the local axis of the camera.
This ensures forward in character movement follows tha Z axis
(forward direction) of the camera.
